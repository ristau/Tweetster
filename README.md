# Project 4 - *MyTwitter*

**MyTwitter** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the Twitter API(https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **18** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [X] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [X] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [X] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [X] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [/] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client - in progress
- [X] User should be able to unfavorite and should decrement favorite count.
- [/] User should be able to unretweet should decrement the retweet count - in progress
- [/] User can pull to refresh. - in progress

Partially implemented all the optionals. Can favorite and unfavorite, with incrementing and decrementing the correct fav count.
Pull to refresh and infinite loading are implemented, but create limit blocks.  

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Implemended section header that displays date and time of tweet (shown in Week 4 GIF, removed in Week 5) 

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):
